  "body": "## Project Description\r\n\r\n### This project provides a high performance cloud solution for ASP.NET Identity Core using Azure Table storage replacing the Entity Framework/MSSQL provider\r\n\r\n[Get the latest from NuGet.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElCamino.AspNet.Identity.AzureTable/)\r\n\r\nThis project is a plug-in to the ASP.NET Identity framework. A [basic understanding.](http://www.asp.net/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity) of the ASP.NET identity framework is required.\r\n\r\nBy default, the ASP.NET Identity system stores all the user information in a Microsoft SQL database using an EntityFramework provider. This project is a replacement of the EntityFramework SQL provider to use Azure Table Storage to persist user information such as (but not limited to): username/password, roles, claims and external login information.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the ASP.NET Identity 2.0 and Core 1.0 Azure Table Storage provider allows one to remove the EntityFramework and Microsoft SQL dependencies from the default implementation of the ASP.NET Identity 2.0 and Core 1.0 storage provider and replace it with a high performance Azure Table Storage solution.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Documentation] for more detailed information about getting started.
